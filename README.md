# p5r.code.multiplayerclient

## Current setup

+ Run the built server executable
+ launch P5R instances via Reloaded-II with the P5R multiplayer mod enabled. Which connect to localhost
(Reccomended to have intro skip patch in P5R Essentials, but do not switch on "Render in background" patch!
## Connecting to remote servers
If you want to connect to remote servers with an ip address that is not localhost:

Open mod.cs in p5r multiplayer client, and change ip address and port to what you want the client to connect to on launch

## Hosting options
You can change what port you host the server on by applying the --port 1234 argument when launching the server
